# BankApp â€“ Encapsulation Example in C#

This project demonstrates **Encapsulation** in C# using a simple `BankAccount` class.  
Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and the methods that operate on it into a single unit (class) while restricting direct access to some components to ensure controlled interaction.
The class hides the balance (`_balance`) as a private field and provides controlled methods for deposits and withdrawals, preventing invalid operations like overdrafts or negative amounts.
